# Training GANs Generative Adversarial Networks using deep-learning-tensorflow-gpu

In this repository I use Tensorflow to implement GANs Generative Adversarial Networks to generate new images based on learned old ones from NIST Handprinted Forms and Characters Database and applying a generator and discriminator and using batch normalization and leaky RELUs.
